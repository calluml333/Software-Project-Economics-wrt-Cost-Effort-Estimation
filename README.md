# Software-Project-Economics-wrt-Cost-Effort-Estimation
The aim of this assignment was to design a genetic algorithm that would evolve a function to predict the total cost/effort of a project, given various attributes about the project, and compare the accuracy of the results with existing cost/effort prediction techniques.
